- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kittysocks / Molly Miraglia. Please feel free to look around my repositories!

- ðŸ‘€ My past programming experience lies within two disciplines, phylogenetics and oncology. I'm always open to using it to help people in need, whether it be for research or social justice!
- I enjoy parsing through text files using  Python and playing around with SQL databases. 
- After extracting and outputting data, I like to visualize in R, mainly using ggplot2.
- I'm always learning and adapting on how complete a task the most efficiently. 

I'm always open to collaborations, especially when involving data visualization (#tidytuesday!)!
