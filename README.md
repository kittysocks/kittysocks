- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kittysocks / Molly Miraglia. Please feel free to look around my repositories!

- I've been working as a Data and Information Analyst since Nov. 2022! All my code lives in a private repository on a separate GitHub account, so that's why my contributions here are a little low! ðŸ˜‡
- I'm working on getting my personal GitHub full of stuff again! Specifically I'm focusing on #tidytuesday since Jan 2024.

- ðŸ‘€ My programming experience lies within multiple disciplines, phylogenetics, oncology and currently Philadelphia Behavioral Health data. I'm always open to using my skills to help people in need, whether it be for research or social justice!
- I enjoy parsing through text files using  Python and playing around with SQL databases. My main method of cleaning data is using R and the #tidyverse package ðŸ¤ 
- I like to visualize in R, mainly using ggplot2, but have dabbled in Tableau.
- I'm always learning and adapting on how complete a task the most efficiently. 

I'm always open to collaborations, especially when involving data visualization (#tidytuesday!)!
