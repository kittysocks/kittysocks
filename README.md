- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kittysocks / Molly Miraglia. Please feel free to look around my repositories!

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in phylogenetics, mainly dealing with molecular evolution. Also more recently, very interested in oncology. I enjoy parsing through text files using  Python and playing around with SQL databases. The SQL Murder Myster (https://mystery.knightlab.com/) has recently been one of my favorite time passers!
After extracting and outputting data, I like to visualize in R, mainly using ggplot2.
I'm always learning and adapting on how complete a task the most efficiently. 

I'm always open to collaborations, especially when involving data visualization (#tidytuesday!)!
