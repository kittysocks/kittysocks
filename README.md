- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kittysocks / Molly Miraglia. Please feel free to look around my repositories!

- I've been in the Data Analytics world career-wise since Nov. 2022! All my code from work lives in a private repository on a separate GitHub account, so that's why my contributions here are a little low! ðŸ˜‡

  ## Portfolio!! 
- Check out my portfolio! I'll be keeping my public work there :) [Portfolio](https://github.com/kittysocks/portfolio)
- I'm working on getting my personal GitHub full of stuff again! I'm trying to be a more active in the #tidytuesday challenges! 
  
- ðŸ‘€ My programming experience lies within multiple disciplines, phylogenetics, clinical research, oncology, demographic data and currently financial/insurance data. I'm always open to using my skills to help people in need, whether it be for research or providing job-aiding metrics!
- I enjoy parsing through text files using Python and playing around with SQL databases. My favorite method of cleaning data is using R and the #tidyverse package ðŸ¤ 
- I like to visualize in R, mainly using ggplot2, but also know how to use Tableau and Qlik. 
- I'm always learning and adapting on how complete a task the most efficiently. 

I'm always open to collaborations!
